1. Home
-> Home page banner with the title to interact the user and little infomration about the hotel and Amenities and footer

2. About us
-> About us page had title with background banner and breadcrums so its easy for user to navigate the page and then information about the hotel.

3. Gallery
-> Gallery page had title with background banner and breadcrums so its easy for user to navigate the page and I have added the Slider in the Gallery Section

4. Contact
